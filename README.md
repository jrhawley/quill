See [this blog post](https://jrhawley.github.io/2020/09/19/financial-statements-quill) for details about the motivation and design implementation of Quill.

## Features

### Customized configuration

A configuration file will automatically be loaded from your user's application settings, if one exists.

| Operating system | Configuration location                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| macOS            | `~/.config/quill/config.toml`             |
| Linux            | `~/.config/quill/config.toml`             |
| Windows          | `~\\AppData\\Roaming\\quill\\config.toml` |

An example configuration file can be found in [`examples/`](examples/config.toml).

### Ignore statements

In the directory for an account whose statements you're checking, you can include a `.quillignore.toml` file with an array of dates and/or file names.
Example ignore files can be found in [`examples/`](examples/).
